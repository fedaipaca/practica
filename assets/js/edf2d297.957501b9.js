The dilemma where to end the test scope, what should be mocked and what's not - is presumably the most strategic test design decision. Consider for example having module A which interacts with module B. If you isolate A by mocking B, A will always pass, even when B's interface has changed and A's code didn't follow. This makes A's tests highly stable but... production will fail in hours.
